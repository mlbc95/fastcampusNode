Same as GS4100, PHLI 4451 and SOC4100

Course Description:  This class is a continuation

of WGST 2102: Introduction to Womens and Gender

Studies, which is a recommended prerequisite.  It

is meant to serve as an initial intellectual

investigation into the concepts of how and why

concerning gender ideologies raised in the

introductory class and as a bridge to the later

advanced gender theory and methods class.  In this

class, we will study interdisciplinary feminist

theories with a focus on gender equality,

including masculinity theory, queer theory, muted

group theory, and other evolving frameworks.

Course Description:  This class is a continuation

of WGST 2102: Introduction to Womens and Gender

Studies, which is a recommended prerequisite.  It

is meant to serve as an initial intellectual

investigation into the concepts of how and why

concerning gender ideologies raised in the

introductory class and as a bridge to the later

advanced gender theory and methods class.  In this

class, we will study interdisciplinary feminist

theories with a focus on gender equality,

including masculinity theory, queer theory, muted

group theory, and other evolving frameworks.

Topic: Power and Practice

Case Competition

Case Competition.  Same as Management 3698.

This course will prepare teams of students to

analyze, synthesize and present a proposed

multifaceted solution to a business problem. Each

year successful students may be invited to compete

in domestic or international case competitions,

such as the UMSL International Business Case

Competition.  Through the use of

cross-disciplinary cases (Management, Finance,

International Business, Accounting, Information

Systems, Marketing),  students working in cross

functional teams will increase their ability to

successfully function in team roles, analytical

abilities, improve their writing and presentation

skills and learn to think more strategically and

analytically.  Student teams will compete as they

solve several cases throughout the semester. 

Employer surveys indicate that while students have

topical course knowledge, experience in applying

that knowledge to concrete problems would better

prepare students for success in early career

roles.

Case Competition

Same as HONORS 3030.  Topic: Case Competition

This course will prepare teams of students to

analyze, synthesize and present a proposed

multifaceted solution to a business problem. Each

year successful students may be invited to compete

in domestic or international case competitions,

such as the UMSL International Business Case

Competition.  Through the use of

cross-disciplinary cases (Management, Finance,

International Business, Accounting, Information

Systems, Marketing),  students working in cross

functional teams will increase their ability to

successfully function in team roles, analytical

abilities, improve their writing and presentation

skills and learn to think more strategically and

analytically.  Student teams will compete as they

solve several cases throughout the semester. 

Employer surveys indicate that while students have

topical course knowledge, experience in applying

that knowledge to concrete problems would better

prepare students for success in early career

roles.

Good, Bad, or It Depends?

Topic: Globalization: Good, Bad, or It Depends 

 

This course seeks to come to terms with one of the

most popular, yet often misunderstood, concepts of

our time. Globalization is a multidimensional

construct, which calls for its study from a

multidisciplinary perspective: i.e., economics,

political science, history, and anthropology. The

course will explore the forces undergirding

economic globalization, as well as the factors

that are giving rise to a global democratic

dispensation, at least in form if not always in

substance. Moreover, it will examine different

types of globalization including archaic

globalization, proto-globalization, and deviant

globalization. The idea here is to assess the

degree to which contemporary globalization

represents rupture or continuity with historical

precedents, and comports (or not) with certain

ideals. Finally, the course will explore cultural

globalization and the rise of a global pop

culture led by the news media, the entertainment

industry, the internet, and aviation, in other

words, communications and transportation

technologies. An important part of the course will

be to do a comparative analysis of the impacts of

globalization in all of its manifestations on

social groups (e.g., men and women, ethnic and

racial minorities, young and old, classes),

countries, and regions. In particular, the class

will examine the impacts of globalization on

Africa (globalized Africa).

Course Description:  This class is a continuation

of WGST 2102: Introduction to Womens and Gender

Studies, which is a recommended prerequisite.  It

is meant to serve as an initial intellectual

investigation into the concepts of how and why

concerning gender ideologies raised in the

introductory class and as a bridge to the later

advanced gender theory and methods class.  In this

class, we will study interdisciplinary feminist

theories with a focus on gender equality,

including masculinity theory, queer theory, muted

group theory, and other evolving frameworks.

Supply Chain Leadership & Stra

Topic: Supply Chain Leadership & Strategy 

Course Description: Transforming an organization

from traditional thinking to Lean thinking

order to navigate through the waters of change

management required to successfully execute and

sustain the Lean supply chain journey.  In this

course, students will complete a deep dive of the

House of Lean and explore the main aspects of lean

leadership. Among other important topics, students

will learn go see management, A3 thinking,

'leader as teacher' concepts, becoming an

effective facilitator and change management,

rooted in GE's Change Acceleration Process (CAP

Model).
