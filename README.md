Now we use [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) which is a library that helps you run two processes at a time... I chose this only because I think it's better to use just one command to boot the whole thing.

To install dependencies `npm instal`
To start the server locally `node server.js`, this will launch the server AND the client altogether.
